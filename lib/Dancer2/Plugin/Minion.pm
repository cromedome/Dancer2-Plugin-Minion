Dancer2::Plugin::Minion - Easy access to Minion job queue in your Dancer2 
applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyApp;
    use Dancer2;
    use Dancer2::Plugin::Minion;

    get '/' => sub {
        add_task( add => sub {
            my ($job, $first, $second) = @_;
            $job->finish($first + $second);
        });
    };

    get '/another-route' => sub {
        my $id = enqueue(add => [1, 1]);
        # Do something with $id
    };

    get '/yet-another-route' => sub {
        # Get a job ID, then...
        my $result = minion->job($id)->info->{result};
    };

    # In config.yml

        Minion:
            dsn: sqlite:test.db
            backend: SQLite

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Dancer2::Plugin::Minion> makes it easy to add a job queue to any of your
L<Dancer2> applications. The queue is powered by L<Minion> and uses a 
backend of your choosing, such as PostgreSQL or SQLite.

The plugin lazily instantiates a Minion object, which is accessible via the
C<minion> keyword. Any method, attribute, or event you need in Minion is 
available via this keyword. Additionally, C<add_task> and C<enqueue> keywords
are available to make it convenient to add and start new queued jobs.

See the L<Minion> documentation for more complete documentation on the methods
and functionality available.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 minion

The L<Minion>-based object. See the L<Minion> documentation for a list of
additional methods provided.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 add_task()

Keyword/shortcut for C<< minion->add_task() >>. See 
L<Minion's add_task() documentation|Minion/add_task> for
more information.

=head2 enqueue()

Keyword/shortcut for C<< minion->enqueue() >>. 
See L<Minion's enqueue() documentation|Minion/enqueue1>
for more information.

=head1 RUNNING JOBS

You will need to create a Minion worker if you want to be able to run your 
queued jobs. Thankfully, you can write a minimal worker with just a few
lines of code:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    use Dancer2;
    use Dancer2::Plugin::Minion;
    use MyJobLib;

    minion->add_task( my_job_1 => MyJobLib::job1());

    my $worker = minion->worker;
    $worker->run;

By using C<Dancer2::Plugin::Minion>, your worker will be configured with 
the settings provided in your F<config.yml> file. See L<Minion::Worker> 
for more information.
